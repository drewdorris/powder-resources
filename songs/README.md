# songs
Resources which mainly utilize songs (.nbs files) in Powder configuration.

.nbs files are in the 'songs' folder, and the Powders which use the songs are in powders.yml.

These songs are pulled from a multitude of sources (Petraller on minecraftforums.net, various online midi collections, musescore, YouTube midi-ers with downloads for their midis, and others) and were mostly converted from midi in [Note Block Studio (NBS)](https://www.stuffbydavid.com/mcnbs). NBS has a great midi->nbs converter, such that a midi converted into a .nbs file will often sound better than a song created in NBS. You can find more resources from those areas, from the [NBS minecraftforum page](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-tools/1260747-minecraft-note-block-studio), or possibly some other location. Dusts with notes were added with them to provide a decent visual.
